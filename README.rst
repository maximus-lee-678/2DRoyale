‚ÑπÔ∏è Description
--------------
* A multiplayer networked top-down battle royale where players battle each other in a shrinking arena. Players can enter their usernames, which are displayed above their characters and in the kill-feed.
* Each player is initially spawned at random locations throughout the map and will need to scavenge for weapons located in crates randomly spawned thorughout the map.
* Weapons include the SMG, Sniper, Rifle and Shotgun.
* Players seek out and eliminate one another until only one player is left standing. 
* A gas wall that deals heavy contact damage closes in to the centre of the playable area as the match progresses, encouraging player engagement.
